**â€œSettings" screen:**
In the sound section, the user changes the volume using a slider inside the scale. He holds his finger on the slider and moves it, thereby changing the volume of the app's sound effects (0 on the left, 100 on the right).
- Back button (returns back to the Main Menu screen)
- Sound setting (static window with the word "Sound", sound icon, volume bar with slider)
- Language setting (left/right button, when clicked changes the RUS / ENG inscription between the buttons), selecting a specific inscription changes the language of the application interface


**Gameplay screen:**
The player connects balls and matching paraphernalia to each other:
tennis ball - racket
football - football player's shoe
basketball - basketball hand
volleyball - volleyball's arm
baseball - bat
golf ball - club
To link cards, the player taps on the chosen card and draws a connecting yellow line away from it. To link to another card, he taps on the desired card and the line connects. If the line is connected correctly, it turns neon green, if incorrectly, it turns neon red.  
If correct, he is given 1 point and the playing field is refreshed. Always the player is given time - the initial time in the timer is 15 seconds. When a player receives 1 point, 5 seconds of timer time is also added. If the wrong choice is made, 5 seconds are taken away from the player. 
The difficulty of the game changes due to the number of cards and their movement on the playing field:
up to 5 points there are only 3 types of cards on the field, the cards are static
from 5 to 10 on the field 6 types of cards, cards are static
From 15 points and above, the cards begin to move around the board within the confines of the screen (every 5 points more the cards begin to move faster);
The game ends when the timer reaches 0.
